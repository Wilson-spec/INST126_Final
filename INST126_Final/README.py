
#Hello, my program consists of Webscraping, a little bit of Regular Expressions, Numpy, Panda
# and Matplotlib. 

#To start off, I webscraped a wikipedia page of Taylor Swift. To be more specific, I webscraped data
# with the <p> attribute and printed that information into a .txt file. (The file should be created for you)

#Secondly, I then brought in regular_expressions in the play. I first counted and read the amount of times
# "Taylor" appeared in the webscraped text, then I made a sequence of expressions of Taylor, such as 'aylor' 'ylor' lor' 
# 'or' and 'r'. and then found the amount of times THOSE sequences appeared in the text and created a dictionary
#  based off the results. 

# Thirdly, after manually creating and inserting the values into the dictioanry, I then used Panda to create 
# a data frame named taylor_data which stores the sequences and after doing that, 
# I then created a CSV file with the data I created/got to fufill the requirment on the 
# checklist, and after using that CSV file, i then used a boolean to only give me sequences >100.

#Lastly, I use matplotlib to help me plot the data I create and got to make various types of graphs.
